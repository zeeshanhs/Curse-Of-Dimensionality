# Curse Of Dimensionality
Here we will take a look at how to deal with Dimensionality and to tame it before getting into model selection and training phase.
***
This is one of the crucial steps (_**4th step**_) according to my **"Guidelines for Machine Learning modeling"**. [<= More on this Later]

## Dataset used:

### Mobile Price Classification
Data contains various different features and our job is to identify WHICH ones to use and HOW to use them.

## Libraries used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Goal of the Practice
* Hands-on detailed practice on Pandas
* Looking at **Feature Selection** techniques
* Looking at **Feature Extraction** techniques
* Visualizations at each step

## Tasks Performed
1. Hands-on detailed practice on Pandas.
2. Step-2 to be added.
